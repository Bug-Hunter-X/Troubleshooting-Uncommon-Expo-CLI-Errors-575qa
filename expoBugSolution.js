The solution depends on the specific error encountered.  Consult the detailed error messages provided by the Expo CLI for targeted solutions.  However, the most frequent solutions include:

1. **Updating the Expo CLI:**
   ```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
2. **Cleaning and reinstalling dependencies:**
   ```bash
rm -rf node_modules
expo install
```
3. **Resolving dependency conflicts:** Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify and resolve version conflicts within your `package.json`.
4. **Reviewing and correcting the configuration files (`package.json`, `app.json`/`expo.json`, `eas.json`):** Make sure the settings are valid and consistent. Check for typos, correct property values, and ensure all necessary fields are present.  Consult the official Expo documentation for proper configuration.
5. **Addressing code-level issues:**  If the problem seems to stem from your application code, debug the code thoroughly to find the source of the error. Look for syntax errors, runtime exceptions, or logical flaws.

Remember to run `expo start` after making these changes to see if the problem is resolved.
