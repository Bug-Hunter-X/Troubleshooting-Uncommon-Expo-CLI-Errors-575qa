This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has inconsistencies or issues within its configuration files, particularly `package.json` and `app.json` (or `expo.json`).  Here's a breakdown of common causes and debugging steps:

**Common Causes:**

* **Incorrect or missing dependencies:**  Ensure all dependencies listed in `package.json` are correctly installed and compatible with your Expo SDK version. Run `expo install` to install or update dependencies.
* **Conflicting dependencies:**  Check for version conflicts between your dependencies. Tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help identify conflicting package versions.
* **Corrupted `node_modules` folder:**  Sometimes, the `node_modules` folder can become corrupted. Try deleting it (`rm -rf node_modules`) and reinstalling dependencies using `expo install`.
* **Outdated Expo CLI:** Update your Expo CLI to the latest version using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
* **Incorrect configuration in `app.json` or `expo.json`:** Double-check the configurations in these files. Typos, incorrect property values, or missing required fields can lead to errors.
* **Issues with EAS Build (if applicable):** If you're using EAS Build, ensure your configuration is correct in `eas.json` and that you've followed all the setup instructions correctly.  Check the EAS Build logs for any error messages.
* **Problems with your project's code:**  While less common, errors within your application's code itself (i.e., a syntax error or a runtime exception) could cause the CLI to fail unexpectedly. Look for other errors in the terminal output that may point towards the problematic code.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify `package.json` and `app.json`/`expo.json`:** Ensure they are correctly structured and contain valid data.
2. **Clean and reinstall dependencies:** Remove `node_modules` and run `expo install`.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `npm install -g expo-cli`.
4. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Investigate `package.json` for conflicts using `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
5. **Examine the complete error message:** The error message might contain valuable clues about what's gone wrong. Look for specific details or file names.
6. **Restart your computer:** Sometimes a simple restart solves odd issues with the CLI.
7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If you still can't find the issue, try creating a new, minimal Expo project and gradually add components from your original project to identify the source of the problem.
