# Troubleshooting Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates common and uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions to fix them.  The errors can range from dependency conflicts to issues within the configuration files (`package.json`, `app.json`/`expo.json`, and `eas.json`).

**Common Scenarios Covered:**

* Incorrectly configured `package.json` and `app.json`/`expo.json` files.
* Conflicting dependencies or missing packages.
* Corrupted `node_modules` folder.
* Issues with EAS Build integration.
* Outdated Expo CLI version.

**How to Use:**

The `expoBug.js` file demonstrates an example of an error, and the `expoBugSolution.js` offers the correct code and explanation to resolve it.  Feel free to experiment and modify these files to simulate other error scenarios.
